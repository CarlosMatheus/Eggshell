# Eggshell

## About

Chat app that lets you create locality-focused public groups, directed on bringing together people from minority groups (like LGBT) in a particular region who want to talk about the cause but without having to expose their real identity.

In these conversation groups, each person chooses whether to use their real identity or use a pseudonym. All people who are anonymous within the group are marked as anonymous. Thus, it is a way to bring together people with common interests, but who have some fear related to disclosing their identity in this group.

In the groups, there is a democratic ban system in which inappropriate messages can be flagged, and if a percentage of the group reports the message to that person's account, they are banned from that group.

### About the Hack-a-project

![Hackathon](https://media.giphy.com/media/KxtQp1oNYWydPQPzls/giphy.gif)

Hack-a-project is a 4-days tech mentoring program, designed for penultimate year students that are interested in learning more about Solutions Engineering at Facebook. Selected students come to the Facebook office for 4 days to focus on understanding the whole development cycle inside the Solutions Engineering team, and build their own project in groups.

Each session consists of a talk and practical applications with group mentoring support from Software and Solutions Engineers.  Besides, it is shared tips on "how to crush your coding interview" and also do a mock interview, where feedback be provided.

## Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
